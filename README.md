# Auto Clicker Program

This program allows for up to ~1,000 clicks per second.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `pynput` library

This can be installed using pip:
```bash
pip install pynput
```

## How To Use

- **Start/Stop/Exit**
  -   Press **`s`** to start clicking.
  -   Press **`e`** to stop clicking.
  -   Press **`Esc`** at any time to exit the program.

## Click Speed Limitations
Note: click speed is based on `time.sleep(0.0001)`, but may be limited due to system limitations.
